CSCI 3033 Group Project Fall 2022<br>
Main Project Objectives:<br>
After all these classes in computer science, you may have a programming idea you would like to<br>
implement.<br>
• Works as part of a team.<br>
• Works with your team to come up with new ideas.<br>
• Use your programming skill to write complicated code.<br>
• Practice writing paper.<br>
• Practice presenting your work.<br>
• Write a GUI “Graphical User Interface” application<br>
Phase 1: Choose a topic and group members 5%</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Turn in the list of member names and 2 potential topics of common interest. Due: 9/07 class</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="25">10% of your final project grade would be added to your final exam if you built an android<br>
application as your Project.<br>
Phase 2: Mid-progress report 20% Due: 10/12 class time<br>
• Name of the Project<br>
• Design of the system<br>
• The work that’s been completed.<br>
• The plan for what will follow.<br>
• Individual assignment.<br>
• Challenges and risks, and how did you overcome or plan to take care of them?<br>
Phase 3: Report and presentation of the Project Due: 11/(21, 27, 29) class time<br>
A – Presentation 20%</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Class presentation with slide highlighting the project goals and benefits.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">Each member needs to present their role in Project.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="29">Implementation of the Project for the demonstration.<br>
B- Documentation 50%</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="33">Full report journal style (IEEE) includes Abstract, Introduction, Material/methods, Results,<br>
Conclusion, References, and Supplementary material such as the code and implementation<br>
procedure. (30%)<br>
Each person in the group will be graded separately.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="40">Once the Project starts, each group member will be expected to keep a timesheet (weekly<br>
achievement of 12 weeks). It is essential to do your share of the group project. (10%) submit at the<br>
end of the semester.<br>
a. An individual timesheet should show the date, time spent, and a short description of the<br>
work done by the group member (weekly)<br>
b. Evaluation of each team member’s participation in your group (what other team member<br>
assignment and achievements for that week)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="74">Each group will keep a record of the minutes for every group meeting. (5%) submit at the end of<br>
the semester.<br>
a. The minutes will briefly describe what decisions are made regarding the Project.<br>
b. The minutes will also outline what part of the work was assigned to each team member.<br>
c. For each project assignment, only one copy per team will be turned in to be graded.<br>
d. Each member should take a turn to record the minutes; the responsible member’s name<br>
should be clearly listed in the minute.<br>
Based upon this one copy and the audit trail found in the time log, the minutes, and the information<br>
found in the final paper, grades will then be assigned to each individual team member.<br>
• A team rubric evaluation will be conducted.<br>
• Efforts will be made to validate and verify any problems before assigning the grades.<br>
The group project will be graded based on the following criteria:<br>
• The correctness of each component and algorithm, code efficiency, readability, and<br>
documentation.<br>
• Each team will turn in the Project a zip file.<br>
• All files should be documented.<br>
• You should turn in a Readme file explaining how to use the system.<br>
